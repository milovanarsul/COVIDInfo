## About

The COVID-19 Pandemic has caused an uproar all over the world, leading to an urgent need for authentic and factual information that can sometimes make the difference between life and death. While pandemics and fake news are not new phenomena, an unprecedented moment in history is taking place today due to the post-digital age we live in. Digital media allows the repeated spread of false news during crises, when accurate and truthful information is needed. Consequently, people's ability to discern between fact and reality is diminishing, and things are so precarious that the main enemy of this pandemic is no longer the virus itself, but misinformation.
The "COVIDInfo" mobile app comes to aid in this unprecedented situation, aiming to combat misinformation and fake news about the ongoing pandemic, giving users information and statistics from reliable and trusted sources.
